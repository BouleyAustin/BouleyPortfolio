This is my second iOS app. I am still working on this project. I started the project on 3/7/19. Since this is my first time developing in Swift, it is taking a little logner than expected. I got my inspiration for this project from a friend who has Celiac disease. They have two apps for everything they need; therefore, I want to make an app that combines those features and adds more. This app will constantly pull new articles related to celiac disease and post it to a UITableView, scan a barcode then determine if the item contains gluten or not, and show the closest restaurants that over gluten free items on their menus.
