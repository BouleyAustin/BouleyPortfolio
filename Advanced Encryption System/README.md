This is a project that I completed in 2017. AES is the current government standard for encryption using a key base. Engima machine was the encryption used during WWII as a dial rotary base. For this project, I mathematically improved the impossibility of cracking the current encryption system by combining it with the best features from the enigma machine. Basically, it changed the key value for each word so some may crack the key but the key is different for every word. I was awarded a $5,000 scholarship by Rice University.
