This app was my first app using Xcode. This app was created using only the storyboard in order for me to learn the platform and learn how to use auto layout to adjust the UITexts, UITextViews, UIButtons, and other UI features. I created Live Saver to teach people CPR and First Aid since my dad wanted an app that he could give his CPR clients to remember the information from his class.
